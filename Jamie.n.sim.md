Interest of content:
Outstanding - All pages differed in content and all were interesting to read
and well informed, 2 of the pages also cited sources for their information
and were correct in their content.

Consistency and quality of visual presentation:
Excellent - The page feels sloped, or at least on my computer it feels as
though the space hasn't been entirely used correctly. However the style is
consistent and impressive, it appears sleek and makes it easy to read consistent

Quality of written presentation:
Outstanding - The content seemed to flow, you could read the majority without
questioning its content. However there were a couple of small errors, for
example capitals or commas in the wrong place. Despite this it is an easy read
because of good paragraphing and interesting content.

Validity of HTML:
Exemplary - HTML validator was harsh. It failed the page purely on the basis
of the images not having 'alt' attributes. Apart from this, the pages pass all
tests.

Evidence of Collaboration:
Author info not written by author (Exemplary)
Balanced contributions from members (Excellent) - One author had roughly a third
of the contributions of the highest contributor. This may be a case of one being
in charge of the homepage etc, although workload was not split evenly.
Not completed at last minute (Exemplary) - Work split almost perfectly over the
past week. Commits from all members appeared to be spread out over the week.
