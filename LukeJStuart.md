Interest of content - Excellent
-------------------
Some of the explanations are quite verbose, however reading the pages does result in learning something new and the content can keep the attention of the reader.

Consistency and quality of visual presentation - Outstanding
----------------------------------------------
Design is consistent throughout, good use of styling. Use of consistent author images is visually pleasing. Spacing of images on home apge is inconsistent, which could be displeasing to some viewers.

Quality of written presentation - Excellent
-------------------------------
There are no grammar or spelling mistakes in the text. The writing is of a publishable quality.

Validity of HTML - Exemplary
----------------
I was unable to find any errors in the HTML, all lines are valid and the use of HTML throughout the site is consistent, other than the lack of alt text for some images.

Evidence of collaboration - Outstanding
-------------------------
All author information was written by someone other than the author in question. There were balanced contributions from all members, with only a slight tilt towards the presumed leader. The work was not coompleted at the last minute, with the last commit being 15 hours before this review.
