i. Interest of content
- Excellent
  Broad range of topics included that all have interesting applications for Computer Science and are relevent to this day and age. 

ii. Consistency and quality of visual presentation
- Exemplary
  All webpages are set out in the same way, each has an image in the same location and that is relevant to the  particular topic. The author pages are especially well created and consistant, with each author having their own
  image that is of the same style and even the written content is completely consistant between all the pages.
  Navigation bar appears on all pages as well as links to the author page on any topic.

iii. Quality of written presentation
- Very good
  A lot of detail on the pages which is seperated into paragraphs. Not too much but also not too little description on each topic which makes it easy to read. 
  Each topic page having it's own subheading under the image adds to the overall quality of the presentation. 
  However, the author pages feel a little bare and could have some more infomation about each author.

iv. Validity of HTML
- Outstanding
  No errors found in HTML. Very well coded. 
  However, an <alt> attribute should be included apparently for <img> elements according to validator.w3.org which is understandable due to the rare chance that the img cannot be found and it would give information about what is missing.

v. Evidence of collaboration
- Outstanding
  Author info is not written by author. Contributions to the repo are fairly well balanced and was not completed last minute, in fact, updates were made throughout the week which is commitment at its finest.

Overall, an incredible effort by the team to create a consistant and interesting set of webpages.
Overall rating: Outstanding
