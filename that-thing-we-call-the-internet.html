                            		<p class="lead">There are <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/iot-devices-will-outnumber-the-worlds-population-this-year-for-the-first-time/" target="_blank">more devices connected to the Internet than there are people on the planet</a>. Most of us use the Internet daily, often taking the tool for granted.</p>
                            		<p>The Internet is a network of interconnected computer networks which spans the globe. Different continents are connected by underwater cables which carry vast volumes of data over hundreds of miles every second.</p>
                                    <p>With so much traffic, it may appear to be a miracle that the Internet works. Essential to the smooth operation of such a large network are protocols. These sets of rules lay out the way in which different devices communicate, allowing a phone designed by Lenovo in China to send an email to a server made by IBM in the USA.</p>
                                    <p>Before the advent of the Internet, knowledge existed in printed material: books, newspapers and journals. Although these sources still exist, the Internet has taken over as the first point of call for many projects that would have once started with a trip to a library.</p>
                                    <p>The Internet hasn’t just revolutionised research, it’s changed the way we communicate. Gone are the days of sending your messages in the post and waiting a week for a response. Thanks to the Internet, we can beam a live video of ourselves to friends and family on the other side of the globe in a matter of seconds.</p>
                                    <p>With technology progressing so rapidly, you’d be forgiven for asking “what on Earth could come next?”. Will we all have smartphone-like devices embedded into our palms in 10 years’ time or will we continue to use the same forms of communication that we rely on so heavily today? Fax was an incredibly popular form of communication during the late 20th century but has since disappeared almost entirely.</p>
                                    <p>The Internet is an incredible resource that we are all fortunate enough to have at our fingertips. Whether or not future generations will laugh at the time we spend in front of screens is something that only time will tell.</p>
